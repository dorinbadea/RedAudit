> **Always** read and follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) at the start of any coding or documentation task. It contains the canonical "Non-Negotiables" and "Contributor Workflow Guidelines" for this project.

## Key Standards Reminder

- **No Emojis**: Do not use emojis in documentation (`.md` files) or release payloads.
- **Bilingual Documentation**: Maintain parity between English and Spanish guides.
- **Release Payloads**:
  - Always include the "Ver en Español" / "View in English" badge at the top.
  - Use absolute URLs for all badge links in releases.
  - Follow the standard structure: Summary, Added, Improved, Fixed, Testing, Upgrade.
- **CI Safety**: Ensure all tests and lints pass locally before pushing.
