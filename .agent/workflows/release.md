# Release Workflow Pointer

This file is a navigation helper. The canonical release workflow lives in `AGENTS.md` (repo root).

Use these sections in `AGENTS.md`:
- `Versioning & Release Checklist (SemVer)`
- `Documentation Consistency Rules`
- `Release Payload Standard`

Follow the **Multi-IDE Pointer Contract** in `AGENTS.md`.
If anything conflicts, `AGENTS.md` is canonical.
