# Agent/Contributor Guidance

This folder provides "initial context" prompts for agent ecosystems and IDE assistants.

Source of truth for this repository is `AGENTS.md` at the repo root.

Entry points by ecosystem:

- Generic AGENTS consumers: `agents/AGENTS.md`
- Cursor: `.cursorrules`
- Agent rules/workflows: `.agent/rules/workflow.md`, `.agent/workflows/pre-push.md`

For all pointer files, follow the **Multi-IDE Pointer Contract** in `AGENTS.md`.
