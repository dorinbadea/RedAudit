- [ ] I read `AGENTS.md` and followed the workflow
- [ ] I worked on a branch and did not commit directly to `main`
- [ ] I ran `pre-commit run --all-files` after changes were final
- [ ] I ran `pytest tests/ -v` (or `scripts/ci_local.sh`)
- [ ] EN/ES docs are in sync (if user-facing behavior changed)
- [ ] No private data is included (`scan_results_private/`)
