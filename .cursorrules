# AGENTS.md Enforcement Rule

> **CRITICAL**: This project has a STRICT engineering protocol defined in `AGENTS.md`.
> **YOU MUST READ `AGENTS.md` AT THE START OF EVERY SESSION/TASK.**

## SYSTEM RULES (MANDATORY)

These rules are lifted from `AGENTS.md` and MUST be followed at the system level. Failure to follow these results in rejected work.

### 1. ABSOLUTE NON-NEGOTIABLES
- **NO EMOJIS**: Do NOT use emojis in ANY documentation, release notes, commit messages, or artifacts. Maintain a professional, neutral tone.
- **WORK ON A BRANCH**: Never commit directly to `main`. Use `feature/`, `hotfix/`, `docs/`.
- **CLEAN HANDOFF**: Ensure `git status` is clean before finishing a task.
- **NO FORCED MERGES**: Wait for CI to pass before merging to `main`.

### 2. RELEASE PROTOCOL (STRICT)
When performing a release (vX.Y.Z), you MUST follow this sequence:
1. **DEPENDENCIES**: Before running tests, ALWAYS run: `pip install -e ".[dev]"` to ensure the environment is correct.
2. **AUDIT REPORT**: You MUST create `docs/AUDIT_REPORT_vX.Y.Z.md` validating the fixes/features.
3. **RELEASE PAYLOAD**: You MUST create a `release_payload.md` file containing the clean release notes (NO EMOJIS) before creating the GitHub release.
   - **Command**: `gh release create vX.Y.Z -t "vX.Y.Z - <Title>" -F release_payload.md`

### 3. AUTHORITY
`AGENTS.md` is the FULL SOURCE OF TRUTH.
- Branching names? See `AGENTS.md`.
- CI failure handling? See `AGENTS.md`.
- Documentation structure? See `AGENTS.md`.

**REFER TO `AGENTS.md` FOR DETAILED PROCEDURES.**
