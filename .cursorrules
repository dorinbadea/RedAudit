# AGENTS.md Enforcement Rule

> **CRITICAL**: This project has a strict engineering protocol defined in `AGENTS.md`.
> **You must read `AGENTS.md` at the start of every session/task.**

## System Rules (Mandatory)

These rules are lifted from `AGENTS.md` and must be followed. If anything conflicts, `AGENTS.md` is canonical.

### 1. Absolute Non-Negotiables
- **No Emojis**: Do not use emojis in documentation, release notes, or release payloads.
- **Work on a Branch**: Never commit directly to `main`. Use `feature/`, `hotfix/`, `docs/`.
- **Owner Approval**: Never merge or push to `main` without explicit owner approval.
- **Local Gate First**: Run the local quality gate before merging; if CI fails after merge, fix immediately and do not force-merge with failing checks.
- **Clean Handoff**: `git status` must be clean before finishing a task.
- **No Retags**: Do not rewrite or retag published releases.
- **Private Data**: `scan_results_private/` must never be pushed.

### 2. Release Protocol (Strict)
When performing a release (vX.Y.Z), follow the `AGENTS.md` checklist, including:
1. **Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements-dev.lock && pip install -e .`
2. **Release Notes**: Create EN/ES notes under `docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_vX.Y.Z*.md`
3. **Private Audit Report**: Create `scan_results_private/AUDIT_REPORT_vX.Y.Z.md` (do not commit)
4. **Release Payload**: Use the EN release notes as payload
   - `gh release create vX.Y.Z -t "vX.Y.Z - <Title>" -F release_payload.md`

### 3. Authority
`AGENTS.md` is the source of truth for:
- Branching names
- CI failure handling
- Documentation structure
- Release steps

Refer to `AGENTS.md` for the full procedures.
