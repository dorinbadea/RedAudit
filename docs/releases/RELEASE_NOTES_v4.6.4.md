## Summary

Refines the **Standard** profile to explicitly ask about "Trust HyperScan", giving users more control over scan optimization without needing the Custom profile.

## Improved

- **Standard Profile**: Now interactively asks "Trust discovery results to speed up deep scans?" (Default: Yes). Previously this was invisible and always enabled.

## Upgrade

```bash
git pull origin main
```
