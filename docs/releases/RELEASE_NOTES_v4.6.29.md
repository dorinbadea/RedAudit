##  Performance Unlocked: Thread Limits Unleashed

In response to modern hardware capabilities (M2/M3 chips, Threadrippers), this release significantly increases the concurrency limits for RedAudit.

### ⚡ Highlights

- **Thread Cap Increased (16 → 100)**: The artificial limit of 16 threads has been lifted. You can now use up to **100 threads** for deep scanning, allowing RedAudit to fully utilize high-performance CPUs.
- **Deep Scan Concurrency**: The Deep Scan phase now respects the global `MAX_THREADS` limit, removing the previous hardcoded cap of 50.
- **Config Integrity**: Fixed a consistency issue where `nuclei_timeout` was missing from the configuration context defaults.

---

### ️ Key Changes

#### Performance

- **Uncapped Threads**: `MAX_THREADS` constant updated to 100.
- **Deep Scan**: Updated logic to use dynamic thread limits.

#### Fixes

- **Config**: Added `nuclei_timeout` to `ConfigurationContext`.

#### Verification

- **Tests**: Added `tests/core/test_thread_limits.py` to verify thread limit adherence.
